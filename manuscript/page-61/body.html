Your race will be spread out over our Empire, sent to the places where they are needed the most.</p><p>"Of course you will not be allowed to retain either your own personalities or your memories. As slaves you would scarcely need them. So they will be stripped from you en route to your new homes, and suitable new slave personalities will be implanted in your minds. You find this thought distasteful I know, but it is the only logical action we can take. You will be born again, so to speak, knowing our language, feeling at home in our way of life and not retaining even a shred of your old patterns of culture. This is the simplest, most efficient way in which your race can become a part of our much larger scheme of things.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"If you do <em>not</em> choose to come peacefully ..." again</p></div> </div>
